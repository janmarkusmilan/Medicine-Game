Creators: Jan Markus Milan, Jasper Caballero

Topics: Nursing / Pharmacology

How the topics are assessed:

The player has to identify the symptoms each patient experiences and determine the best medicine to give to them. The player will become increasingly familiar with each medicine the more they play the game. If the player has no experience with medicine, they will learn, and if they have prior experience, it will assess their knowledge.

– If the correct medicine is given, they get three out of three stars.
